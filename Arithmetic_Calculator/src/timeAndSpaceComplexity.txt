Time complexity:
Each line has a length of n, so everytime the program is iterating through the string
that has a complexity of O(n). Furthermore, every operation performed on the stack has
a constant time complexity of O(1). In the expandCapacity() method, in the Stack class,
the capacity is extended by doubling the size, this method minimizes the amount of times we
have to resize the array, which makes it more efficient and takes O(n) time.
Therefore, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n).

Space complexity:
The stacks must contain enough space for the n characters in the expression.
The space required for the other variables as well as that of the input and output is a
constant space complexity of O(1).
Therefore, the space complexity of this algorithm is O(n).
